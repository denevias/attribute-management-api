# Axiomatics Demo
This is an implementation of a simple microservice having an inventory of entities related to Axiomatics (AttributeDefinition).
<br/>
**Note: The project requires a running PostgreSQL instance.** 

### How to build/run
* Run `./gradlew build` to build the application jar.
* Run just the service only by using `./gradlew bootRun`, but you need to have a PostgreSQL instance running. Check application.yml for the connection details.
